; All possible combinations of rail pieces must be listed; however, the system will automatically generate reverse combos and back combos.
; eg, given the combo a + b east -> c south, the combo b + a west -> c east will be generated, as will c + a south -> c north and
; c + b west -> c north. 

; ortho-straight needs some extra combinations because it's symmetrical.
; diag-straight will likely have the same issues.
