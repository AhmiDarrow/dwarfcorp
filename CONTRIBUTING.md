# Contributing to DwarfCorp
## Licensing

Although *DwarfCorp* is open source, our license gives us ownership over non-code art assets, characters, trademarks, logos, etc. The source code is under an MIT license, the art assets are under a proprietary license.
That means you are free to fork *DwarfCorp* and use the source code in any way (including in commercial projects). You are also free to submit contributions in the form of pull requests **provided that all submitted source code and art assets fall under our license**.

Implications:
1. All source code submitted via pull request must carry the MIT license, or else must have our license in the header of the file. You agree to abide by the MIT license by submitting source code to *DwarfCorp*.
2. By submitting art assets to the project, you relinquish ownership of the assets and they fall under our proprietary license.
3. Dependencies of your source code should have licenses that allow commercial distribution, and are non-viral (no GPL please).

## Minimum Standards
Make sure at the very least that your source code compiles and runs and more or less follows the formatting/naming conventions in the project.

## Submitting a Pull Request
The pull request should have

1. A descriptive title.
2. Reasoning for why the change was made.
3. Some notes on testing that was done on the pull request.

Someone from Completely Fair Games will take a look at your pull request and make a decision (possibly with notes for how to edit the submission) on whether it should be merged in.
