# DwarfCorp
[DwarfCorp](www.dwarfcorp.com) from [Completely Fair Games](www.completelyfairgames.com) is a single player tycoon/strategy game for PC. In the game, the player manages a corporate colony of dwarves. The dwarves must mine resources, build structures, and contend with the natives to survive.

## Licensing
The game is released under a modified MIT licensing agreement. That means all *source code* is free to use, modify and distribute. However, we have explicitly disallowed modification and redistribution of the following game content (which remains proprietary):

* Images/Textures
* 3D Models
* Sound Effects
* Music

No forks, binary redistributions, or other redistributions of this repository may include the proprietary game content. It is up to the redistributor to provide their own game content. "Source code" may also include raw text files, JSON library files, and XML configuration files (which are not considered proprietary "game content").

It's complicated. If you have a question about the licensing, raise an issue on the repository.
